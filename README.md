  ## STEP - 4
üß† Why Step 4: Embedding + Semantic Search?
üéØ Problem with Current Setup (KMeans + TF-IDF):
TF-IDF is keyword-based: it can‚Äôt understand meaning or similarity if the words don‚Äôt match exactly.

Example:

User searches: ‚Äúgit push fails after rebase‚Äù

Your TF-IDF model may not match: ‚Äúunable to push branch due to upstream mismatch‚Äù

‚ùå TF-IDF doesn‚Äôt "know" those are related.
‚úÖ That‚Äôs where semantic search comes in.

üí° What is Semantic Search?
Semantic search finds results based on meaning, not just word match.

Example:
Query: "can't pull docker image from private registry"

Match: "Artifactory Docker authentication fails with 403"

Even though the words are different, they‚Äôre semantically similar.

üîç What Are Embeddings?
An embedding is a vector (list of numbers) that represents the meaning of a sentence.

For example:

"docker pull fails" ‚Üí [0.12, -0.03, ..., 0.98] (384-dimensional vector)

"can't download image from registry" ‚Üí a very similar vector

So now you can compare meaning using math (cosine distance, L2, etc.)

üß† What is BERT (and Sentence-BERT)?
BERT = Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

It‚Äôs a powerful language model that understands sentence meaning

Sentence-BERT (S-BERT) = A tuned version that outputs embeddings for entire sentences, not just words

We‚Äôll use this model:

python
Copy
Edit
sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
‚úÖ Lightweight
‚úÖ Fast
‚úÖ Good accuracy

üì¶ What is FAISS?
FAISS = Facebook AI Similarity Search
It‚Äôs a vector database that:

Stores your embeddings (all 15k questions)

Quickly finds most similar entries to a user‚Äôs query

Instead of searching by keyword, you search by meaning.

üîÅ Summary: What Step 4 Will Do
Step	Action
‚úÖ 1	Embed each question (title + body) using Sentence-BERT
‚úÖ 2	Store all those vectors in FAISS index
‚úÖ 3	Accept user queries, embed them too
‚úÖ 4	Use FAISS to return the most similar questions from the dataset
‚úÖ 5	Show result with original title + answer + cluster label (from Step 3)
